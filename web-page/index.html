	<p align=center>Here are some images generated by a set of fractal programs written by
	Rodrigo Guzman, David Jordan, and Nathan Collins (me!).  The program generates bitmaps based on a few parameters
	including function type, coloring scheme, image position, and iteration constant.
	David Jordan has another page devoted to our work at
	<a href=http://gladstone.uoregon.edu/~djordan><i>Project Julia</i></a>

	<p align=center>Here is the <a href=bin/julia.exe>executable</a> for anyone interested in making some fractals.
	The program takes 0 or 1 arguments when called from the command line and then prompts
	for parameters. If 1 arg is passed it is interpreted as a file name, otherwise a file
	name is constructed from the parameters passed.  The second method is recommended.
	</p>
	<p align=center>The main code is available <a href=bin/juliaF.cpp>here</a>.  It's only one of a few
	files but it contains the actual algorithm and thus should be of the most interest.
	The other files are mostly concerned with generating an intermediate temp.nrd file to
	be later converted to the .bmp, buffering memory if necessary, and performing the
	functions.  The program will generate files up to the size of the largest positive signed
	long or about 2^31 or roughly 2 gigabytes.  When generating large files keep in mind that
	the program does not delete the temp file it creates during operation. The conversion code
	is <a href=bin/FINALbitmapwriter.h>here</a> for anyone interested.
